# Education 

This repository will contain all material that is used to provide education across our platform, whether that's through workshops, courses, talks and other  events. 

It's best practise to try to accrue credible and previously defined educational resources from other established entities before attempting to produce or collate information. 

In general educational material for upcoming months should be based around singular and intensive workshops, and course material.
